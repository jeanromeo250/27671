🧠 Project Description: INNOVACION_SYSTEM
INNOVACION_SYSTEM is a comprehensive, multi-domain software suite designed to simulate real-world enterprise operations across various sectors including inventory management, payroll processing, flight booking, student attendance tracking, and organizational metadata handling. Developed using Java, Python, and C#, this project showcases modular design, structured data handling, and practical application of object-oriented programming principles.

🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a unified framework for managing diverse business processes in educational, commercial, and administrative environments. Each module is crafted to reflect realistic workflows, making it ideal for academic demonstration, training, or prototype development.

🧩 Key Modules
Inventory & Warehouse Management Tracks products, suppliers, categories, and stock levels with detailed summaries and entity relationships.

Flight Booking System Captures flight schedules, passenger details, ticketing information, and airport logistics.

Payroll Processing Computes salaries, overtime, deductions (NHIF, NSSF, PAYE), and generates payroll summaries for employees.

Student Attendance Tracker Logs attendance records, calculates participation percentages, and generates academic reports.

Organizational Metadata Engine Stores and retrieves structured metadata for institutions, departments, and projects with compliance attributes.

Formal Verification (NuSMV) Validates logical properties of the system using model checking to ensure correctness and reliability.

🛠 Technologies Used
Languages: Java, Python, C#

Tools: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, NuSMV Model Checker
